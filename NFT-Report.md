**SOL NFT Report and Outlook - 2022**
=====================================


-Main takes from this year
-Highlights of highest sales/volume
-What were the trends? PFP's, blue-chip derivatives, builders
-Some NFT mints seem like earyl stage project investing/seed stage 




**Are we _really_ early?**
==========================

-Considering the TVL for DeFi on SOL compared to ETH and the MC of SOL NFT's, it's safe to say that we _might_ be early enough for 2022 to be a great SOL NFT year. 
-OpenSea adopting SOL would bring a sense of familiarity to NFT collecters from ETH. 
-Seeing many .ETH domains on twitter updating to include .SOL is a good sign
-More ETH players entering the space
